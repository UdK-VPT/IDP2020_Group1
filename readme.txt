~~ EXECUTION ~~

Kindly note the following while executing the web app.

1 ) Please follow the instructions on each webpage while providing data as inputs.
2 ) PLEASE... do not click on a "submit" button in any page more than 1 time.
NOTE : In the last page, the program takes a while to execute the code and return the final results webpage. You need to wait 
patiently during the execution period. If you click on submit button again, while waiting for the output, the program will crash. 
3 ) ALWAYS KEEP POINT 2 IN MIND. PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! DO NOT CLICK ON A SUBMIT BUTTON MORE THAN ONCE!

~~ TROUBLESHOOTING ~~

While testing the code, one of the problems we ran into was that, after a certain point, even though the user inputs are changed, 
the app would continue to show results stored from an earlier instance.
If the problem appears, please clear the cached memory from your browser and re-launch the app.
